# Trivia - time
## A quick easy cross-platform, multiplayer, browser game
### Issues:
* we'll start here since there's more issues than features at the moment
* Integrate good timer from /game/timer/
* get monitor into sequence back
* eventually wrap in a MVC framework, Angular prob
* remove shaky timer and all traces of it, except container div
